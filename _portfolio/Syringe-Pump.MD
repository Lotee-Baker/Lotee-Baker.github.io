# Design

Gear-ate Syringe Pump
As a key member of a collaborative team, the Gear Gurus, I contributed to the design and fabrication of a functional syringe pump as part of our rapid prototyping course. Our project encompassed three main sectors: CAD, circuitry, and coding, emphasizing teamwork and communication. 

Design and Fabrication: 
Using Fusion 360, I designed custom components such as end supports, a motor mounting plate, and an enclosure, ensuring compatibility with both 10 mL and 20 mL syringes. These components were then sliced and 3D printed.
