# Interactive Zombie Head Animatronic Installation

**Client:** Flag Tag AZ, Flagstaff, AZ  
**Role:** Independent Contractor  
**Timeline:** May 2024 – August 2024  

---

## Project Overview
I designed and installed an **interactive zombie head animatronic** as a themed target in a Flag Tag's laser tag arena. The goal was to create an **immersive, durable, and budget-conscious** feature that elevated the guest experience.

---

## Design & Development
- **Concept:** A zombie head that will pop out of a tank in the areana for randomly timed intervals. This zombie head will have a laser sensor in its mouth so that players can shoot at it to gain points in the game.    
- **Structural Reinforcement:** To do this I first needed to reinforce the tank’s supports to handle the new animatronic infastructure.   
- **Animatronic Engineering:** Integrated a **pneumatic actuator, air compressor, and solenoid** system, controlled with an **Arduino Uno** for responsive motion.

## Materials Used
- **2 gallon Limodot Portable Air Compressor (ultra quiet)**
- **1/4-inch NPT Male Connector Adaptor**
- **Tailonz Pneumatic Blue 1/4 Inch Air Tubing**
- **Tailonz Pneumatic 1/4th NPT Solenoid Valve**
- **Tailonz Pneumatic Female 1/4 Connector Adaptor**
- **Arduino Uno REV3**
- **Breadboard jumper wires**
- **12V power supply**
- **Power cord**
- **Zombie Head (animatronic target)**
- **Laser Reciever**

## Installation & Execution
- Completed the project for less than 600 dollars, 40% under budget.   
- Maintained clear communication with arena management, aligning technical choices with storytelling goals.  
- Delivered a solution that balanced creative ambition with operational reliability.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Entertainment Engineering Design  
- Pneumatics & Mechanical Integration  
- Show Control (Arduino-based interactivity)  
- Project Management & Client Communication  

---

## Impact
The animatronic quickly became a **signature attraction feature**, boosting player engagement and enhancing the arena’s overall entertainment value.  
This project also expanded my expertise in **hands-on entertainment technology** and strengthened my ability to deliver immersive, guest-focused experiences.
