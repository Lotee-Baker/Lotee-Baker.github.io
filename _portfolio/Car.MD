# ME 2160 Final Project – Spirit Car

**Course:** ME 2160  
**Team:** Lotee Baker & Sebastien Jacques  
**Timeline:** Fall 2024  

---

## Project Overview
For our ME 2160 final project, our team set out to design and build a small gear-driven car that could **travel 10 feet unassisted** while also embodying Vanderbilt school spirit. Using a provided hardware kit, laser-cut plywood, and 3D-printed components, we developed a car that not only met the performance requirements but also won the **“Most School Spirit” award** among our peers.

---

## Design Goals
- Car must travel at least **10 feet** reliably.  
- Fit within an **8” × 8” × 8”** dimension box.  
- Use provided kit parts for motors, batteries, and gears.  
- Maintain a gear ratio of at least **3:1**.  
- Reflect **Vanderbilt pride** with decorative elements.  

---

## Design and Engineering
- **Gear Train:** We chose a 10:55 gear ratio, maximizing torque and allowing the car to pull more weight. Four motors powered an all-wheel-drive configuration.  
- **Prototyping:** Our first chassis was laser cut from ⅛” plywood. Early testing revealed design flaws: misaligned axles, gears rubbing on the ground, and limited clearance.  
- **Iteration:** We redesigned the chassis in **SolidWorks**, adjusted axle spacing, and added larger TPU 3D-printed wheels to improve traction. Doubling tire width further increased grip.  
- **Aesthetics:** The car body was painted as a football field with **“Shock the World”** written on the side. A 3D-printed Diego Pavia stomped on Alabama’s elephant mascot while the car dragged a golden goalpost.

## Bill of Materials

| Component                       | Specification                | Purpose |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| **Motors (×4)**                 | Provided kit motors          | Powered all-wheel drive |
| **Batteries**                   | 9V (from kit)                | Supplied power to motors |
| **Gears**                       | 10:55 ratio (kit)            | Increased torque for traction |
| **Chassis**                     | Laser-cut ⅛” plywood         | Structural base for drivetrain |
| **Wheels**                      | 3D-printed TPU, wide tires   | Improved traction and stability |
| **Fasteners & Adhesives**       | Screws, glue                 | Assembly and reinforcement |
| **Decorations**                 | Paint, 3D-printed figures, goalpost | Vanderbilt school spirit aesthetic |

---

## Results
- The car **successfully traversed 10 feet**, meeting the performance requirement.  
- While it didn’t win the tractor pull, it showcased reliable operation and strong torque.  
- Earned the **“Most School Spirit” award**, voted by classmates.  
- Proved both functional and creative, merging engineering with storytelling.  

---

## Skills Highlighted
- SolidWorks CAD (modeling, assemblies, renderings)  
- Gear ratio analysis and drivetrain design  
- Laser cutting and rapid prototyping  
- 3D printing for functional parts (tires, decorative pieces)  
- Team collaboration and project management  

---

## Reflection
This project taught us the value of **iterative prototyping**: our first design failed due to gear clearance issues, but redesigning quickly led to a successful outcome. We also gained experience balancing **technical performance** with **creative presentation**, learning that engineering can both **solve problems and tell stories**.
