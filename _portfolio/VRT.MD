**Role:** Project Engineering Intern, Conagra Brands  
**Timeline:** Summer 2025

## The Problem  
The **Variable Retention Freezer (VRT)** is a bottleneck in frozen meal production. Two production lines combined to send more than 70 cases per minute toward a single **Darb sorter**, rated for only 57 cases per minute. The result was jams, dropped cases, and costly downtime that rippled through the entire plant.  

---

## Concept Development  
I proposed adding a **second Darb sorter** to split the flow. This would effectively double throughput and allow growth if palletizing robots or the freezer itself were upgraded later. 

Two layouts were considered:  
- **Underneath the existing sorter**: Improved ground-level access but limited operator reach to center lanes.  
- **Above the existing sorter**: Preserved access but required complex modifications and tighter clearances.

After team discussion, we chose the **underneath option** as the most practical balance.  

---

## Design & Implementation  
I modeled the system in **Fusion 360**, confirming clearances between conveyors, overhead structures, and cases in motion. I designed a new **bad-scan lane** to integrate with the existing operator recheck process, ensuring mislabeled cases could still be handled effectively. 

To preserve operator access, I designed a **staircase to the overhead platform**, allowing safe access to palletizing lanes despite tighter space. I also coordinated contractor quotes and validated the cost analysis.

## Results  
The final design **doubled throughput** capacity of the outfeed system, shifting the bottleneck downstream while significantly reducing unplanned downtime. Financial analysis confirmed a **one-year ROI**, saving the plant hundreds of thousands annually.  

This project gave me hands-on experience in balancing **process flow optimization, space constraints, operator safety, and ROI**, while showing me the value of clear communication between engineering and operations teams.
