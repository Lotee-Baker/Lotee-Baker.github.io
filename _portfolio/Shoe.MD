# Gait Training Device for Physical Therapy (Shoe Drop)

**Initiative:** TOM (Tikkun Olam Makers)  
**Role:** Team Designer & Builder  
**Timeline:** October 2023  

---

## Project Overview
As part of a volunteer initiative called **TOM (Tikkun Olam Makers)**, our team developed an innovative gait training device for patients at the Pi Beta Phi Clinic. This weekend project combined **engineering and empathy** to improve mobility training for individuals in need.

---

## Collaboration and Brainstorming
Working closely with my team, we explored and refined several design concepts to create a versatile assistive device. Our collaborative process ensured that all voices were heard, resulting in a well-rounded solution that addressed real rehabilitation needs.

---

## Design and Engineering
Using **SolidWorks**, I helped design a **3D-printed device with a toe-rocker shape**.  
- The rocker reduces friction and allows for a greater range of motion while dragging the foot.  
- Adjustable straps enable quick attachment to the non-dominant leg across a variety of shoe sizes.  
- This design helps patients **gain confidence as they relearn to walk**.  

---

## Materials Used
- **SolidWorks CAD** (for design and modeling)  
- **3D Printer + PLA Filament** (for prototyping the toe rocker)  
- **Adjustable Nylon Straps** (to secure the device to shoes of various sizes)  
- **Velcro Fasteners & Clips** (for easy attachment and removal)  
- **Hand Tools** (cutting, drilling, assembly adjustments)  

---

## Community Impact
By focusing on accessibility and simplicity, our team delivered a tool that enhances rehabilitation sessions for patients recovering from mobility loss. The Shoe Drop device shows how small design interventions can make a big difference in peopleâ€™s lives.

---

## Skills Highlighted
- Collaboration  
- SolidWorks CAD Design  
- Prototyping & Rapid Iteration  

---

## Reflection
This project not only strengthened my technical design skills, but also reinforced the value of **teamwork and empathy in engineering**. It reminded me that engineering solutions can directly improve the quality of life for others.
