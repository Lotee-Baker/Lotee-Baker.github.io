**Role:** Project Engineering Intern, Conagra Brands  
**Timeline:** Summer 2025

## The Problem  
At Conagra’s Council Bluffs facility, dough transfer was being done manually. During full speed production, operators were moving **over 1,000 lbs of dough more than 30 feet across the floor every 7.5 minutes** to feed two pot pie production lines from a single automatic batch mixer (ABM).

This was not only **physically demanding and unsafe for operators**, but it also introduced **quality concerns** because of the manual handling. 

---

## Goal  
My goal was to **improve operator safety by designing a system that fully automates the dough transfer between one ABM and two pot pie production lines**.  

The design needed to:  
- Handle the **full volume of dough currently produced**.  
- Be **sanitary and easy to clean**. 
- integrate into the available footprint and avoid changes to existing equipment or facility structures.
- Avoid obstructing **human, pallet jack, and forklift traffic** to the two production lines.  
- Be **financially viable**, with a return on investment acceptable to the business.  

---

## Design Options  
I started by developing and presenting two different designs: 

![Sol 1 & 2 Pros & Cons](/assets/img/Dough3.jpeg)

1. **Double Conveyor Belt System**  
   - Elevated the dough transfer above the floor.  
   - Left overhead clearance for forklifts and pallet jacks.  
   - Allowed access to both production lines without interfering with floor traffic.  

2. **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**  
   - Replaced operator handling with robots to transport dough.  
   - Very flexible, but the contractor quote was extremely expensive.  

I led a project team meeting to review the pros and cons of each option. While the AGV solution was interesting, the **cost was prohibitive**. The **overhead conveyor design** was chosen because it was **more cost-effective** and also reduced floor congestion in a pathway heavily used by forklifts and pallet jacks.  

---

## Engineering the Solution  
Once the design direction was chosen, I worked with our selected contractor (PFI) to refine the plan.  

- Using **Fusion 360**, I modeled the conveyor system and measured critical distances such as **clearance between the dough path and the ceiling**, and the space available for forklifts and pallet jacks.  
- I collected and finalized **contractor quotes** for conveyor belts, demolition, and electrical work.  
- This gave us a full cost estimate, which I presented in the final deliverable.

## Results & ROI  
The final design eliminated the need for manual dough transfer and created a completely automated, **safer, more efficient process**.  

- Operators were removed from a repetitive, high-strain task.  
- Traffic flow on the floor was reduced, improving efficiency.  
- Product quality improved with more consistent handling.  
- The project delivered a **2-year ROI** based on safety improvements and labor savings.

## Reflection  
This project gave me the opportunity to lead design discussions, evaluate tradeoffs, and **take a concept all the way to a fully costed, contractor-approved solution**. It also reinforced how important it is to balance **technical feasibility, operator safety, and financial justification** in real-world engineering projects.
