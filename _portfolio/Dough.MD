**Role:** Project Engineering Intern, Conagra Brands  
**Timeline:** Summer 2025  

---

## The Challenge  
At Conagra’s Council Bluffs facility, operators were manually moving **1,000 lbs of dough every 7.5 minutes** across 30 feet of floor to supply two pot pie production lines. This work was repetitive, physically demanding, and introduced risks to both operator safety and product consistency.  

---

## Exploring Solutions  
I began by brainstorming and modeling two automation strategies.  

- **Overhead Double Conveyor System**: Elevating the dough transfer path above the floor, ensuring clearance for forklifts and pallet jacks, while keeping access to both lines clear.  
- **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)**: Replacing manual transfer with mobile robots, a flexible but expensive option that added traffic in an already busy space.  

After leading a review with the project team, we selected the **overhead conveyor system**, which provided safety and efficiency at a manageable cost.  

---

## Engineering the Design  
With the solution chosen, I built a **Fusion 360 model** of the conveyor system to confirm spacing between the dough path, ceiling, and mobile equipment like pallet jacks. I also gathered and finalized contractor quotes covering conveyors, demolition, electrical, and installation.  

The financial analysis showed a **two-year ROI**, driven by labor savings and reduced ergonomic risks.  

---

## The Outcome  
By the end of the summer, I had delivered a fully costed and validated design. The automated conveyor solution eliminated manual dough transfer, improving **safety, ergonomics, and product quality** while freeing operators for higher-value tasks.  

This project reinforced my ability to merge technical design with cost analysis and contractor coordination — skills I will continue to build as I pursue large-scale system design.
