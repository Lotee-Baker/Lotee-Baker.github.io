Welcome to my Portfolio 

My experience spans animatronics, prototyping, structural design, and mechatronics, with projects ranging from a zombie animatronic for a laser tag arena to a gait training device for physical therapy.

This portfolio showcases how I apply engineering fundamentals, hands-on fabrication, and problem-solving to create solutions that are both practical and engaging.
